// but for Product_List, it will always be 1.00 for price for 1 lb/oz or 1 of an item. Use Description to 
// specify. Price will be money type because there should be no fractional money.

// Loose_Sale

// strictly match quantity.

// A customer buys 4 of an item. The customer gets the 2 for 1 deal and then pays normal price for the 
// remaining one. If it's like 3 for $1, then 5 will be $1 + 2*normal price. use Description to specify what
// kind of deal.

// Receipt
// Receipt for the customer. Takes original price and subtracts sale price to find discount.

// Product_History
// Date and Price are arrays and must have same number of elements to match up price change dates
